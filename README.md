# leapUiExperiments
This is a UI prototype based off [Sword Art Online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_Art_Online) – it's an Anime that I guess a lot of people like. I've never watched it, so if I got something terribly wrong, forgive me. This is pretty hacky - and not ready to be an actual UI, but with some tooling and understanding I don't have yet, I think it could be there.
